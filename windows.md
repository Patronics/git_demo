## Windows users:

If you're running windows rather than a UNIX-based system (typically macOS or Linux), then you'll need to download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)

Installing *Git for windows* also adds a bash-like shell, allowing you to follow along using other UNIX-style commands such as **cd**, **ls**, **nano**, and **cat**
